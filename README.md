# Chess Engine Maat

Maat is a personal hobby chess engine written in C++. It’s a playground for
exploring chess, programming, and algorithms. While it’s just a side project, it
aims to learn, experiment, and maybe one day reach a playable strength.

Maat stands for order and balance – in chess as in the universe.
In Egyptian mythology, Maat represents truth and harmony, keeping chaos in
check. Her feather was used to weigh the souls of the dead – just like this
engine weighs the balance of a position.
And the name’s a little wordplay on mate: a chess mate, or just a buddy to play
with.
